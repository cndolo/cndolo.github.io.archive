[NetworKit](https://github.com/networkit/networkit) is an open-source tool suite
for high-performance network analysis with multiple regular contributors.
It is developed in C++ for high performance, but is exposed as a Python module
to users.

The algorithms implemented in C++ are exposed to Python via
[Cython](https://cython.org/) -- a superset of Python providing bindings between
C-like languages and Python.
I generally refactored a lot of code while I contributed to this project, e.g.,
I was significantly involved in modularisation of the Cython interface from one
giant file to several modules.

<b>New Technologies</b>
