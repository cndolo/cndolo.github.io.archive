    abstract  = { The Lightning network (LN) offers a solution to Bitcoin’s
                 scalability limitations by providing fast and private off-chain
                 payments. In addition to the LN’s long known application-level
                 centralisation, recent work has highlighted its centralisation
                 at the network-level which makes it vulnerable to attacks on
                 privacy by malicious actors. In this work, we explore the LN’s
                 susceptibility to censorship by a network-level actor such as a
                 malicious autonomous system. We show that a network-level actor
                 can identify and censor all payments routed via their network by
                 just examining the packet headers. Our results indicate that it
                 is viable to accurately identify LN messages despite the fact
                 that all inter-peer communication is end-to-end encrypted.
                 Additionally, we describe how a network-level observer can
                 determine a node’s role in a payment path based on timing,
                 direction of flow and message type, and demonstrate the
                 approach’s feasibility using experiments in a live instance of
                 the network. Simulations of the attack on a snapshot of the
                 Lightning mainnet suggest that the impact of the attack varies
                 from mild to potentially dramatic depending on the adversary and
                 type of payments that are censored. We analyse countermeasures
                 the network can implement and come to the conclusion that an
                 adequate solution comprises constant message sizes as well as
                 dummy traffic.},

    abstract     = {The Lightning network (LN) addresses Bitcoin’s scalability
                    issues by providing fast and private payment processing. In
                    order to mitigate failures caused by insufficient channel
                    capacities, LN introduced multi-path payments. To the best
                    of our knowledge, the effect of multi-path payments remains
                    unclear. In this paper, we therefore study the impact of
                    multi-path payments on performance and privacy. We identify
                    metrics quantifying the aforementioned properties and
                    utilise them to evaluate the impact of multi-path payments.
                    To this end, we develop a simulator implementing
                    pathfinding in LN using single and multi-path payments as
                    well as various pathfinding algorithms. We find that, while
                    the success rate of multi-path payments is up to 20%
                    higher, the impact of multi-path payments on performance
                    otherwise remains within limits. On the other hand, the
                    impact on privacy appears to be greater, e.g., multi-path
                    payments are more likely to encounter an on-path adversary
                    and the relationship anonymity is more likely to be
                    compromised by colluding intermediate hops. However,
                    multi-path payments are less likely to be deanonymised
                    based on the path lengths.},

                    solution to consensus in permissionless systems by adapting
                    the well-studied Byzantine agreement model to
                    permissionless consensus. Unlike its counterparts in the
                    context of permissionless consensus, the FBAS system model
                    does not offer validating nodes protocol-level incentives
                    although they are entrusted with safeguarding and ensuring
                    the functionality of the system. Multiple studies have
                    reported on the small number of active validators in these
                    systems leading to some concerns about their resilience. To
                    this end, this paper studies how rewards can be distributed
                    in FBASs and presents a fair reward distribution function
                    for FBASs. The challenge is that, on the one hand,
                    consensus in an FBAS is found jointly between all nodes
                    and, on the other hand, nodes do not all contribute equally
                    to this process. We draw on game-theoretic methods to
                    quantify these contributions bearing the overall health of
                    the FBAS in mind and present a fair reward distribution
                    function which we evaluate based on a set of identified
                    properties.},

    abstract  = {Federated Byzantine Agreement Systems (FBASs) are a
                 fascinating new paradigm in the context of consensus
                 protocols. Originally proposed for powering the Stellar
                 payment network, FBASs can instantiate Byzantine quorum
                 systems without requiring out-of-band agreement on a common
                 set of validators; every node is free to decide for itself
                 with whom it requires agreement. Sybil-resistant and yet
                 energy-efficient consensus protocols can therefore be built
                 upon FBASs, and the “decentrality” possible with the FBAS
                 paradigm might be sufficient to reduce the use of
                 environmentally unsustainable proof-of-work protocols. In this
                 paper, we first demonstrate how the robustness of individual
                 FBASs can be determined, by precisely determining their safety
                 and liveness buffers and therefore enabling a comparison with
                 threshold-based quorum systems. Using simulations and example
                 node configuration strategies, we then empirically investigate
                 the hypothesis that while FBASs can be bootstrapped in a
                 bottom-up fashion from individual preferences, strategic
                 considerations should additionally be applied by node
                 operators in order to arrive at FBASs that are robust and
                 amenable to monitoring. Finally, we investigate the reported
                 “open-membership” property of FBASs. We observe that an often
                 small group of nodes is exclusively relevant for determining
                 liveness buffers and prove that membership in this top tier is
                 conditional on the approval by current top tier nodes if
                 maintaining safety is a core requirement.},
