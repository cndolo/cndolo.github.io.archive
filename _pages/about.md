Hi, I am Charmaine (she/her) and I am currently working towards my PhD at the
Technical University of Dresden under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Florian
Tschorsch](https://tu-dresden.de/ing/informatik/sya/ps/chair/tschorsch).

I am a computer scientist (Master's from the Humboldt University in Berlin) with
special interests in modern P2P systems.
My main research interests are in the performance, security and resilience of
blockchain-based P2P networks such as the Lightning network.
My work tends to follow quantitative and empirical methods such as network
measurements and simulations, while often applying methods from adjacent fields
of computer science such as graph theory and game theory.

During my Master's, I worked on some more theoretical aspects of
distributed computing such as incentives and the  analysis of open quorum
systems (under [Dr. Martin Florian's](https://m.flrn.cc/) supervision).
Prior to that, I worked on the analysis of complex graphs as a student assistant
in the [macsy
group](https://www.informatik.hu-berlin.de/de/forschung/gebiete/macsy).

I am also an amateur baker and often spend my free time trying out new recipes.
As of early 2024, I am a certified football referee in the Dresden football
association and regularly officiate local games.
