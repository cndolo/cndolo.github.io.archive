Hi, I am Charmaine (she/her) and I am currently working towards my PhD at the
Technical University of Dresden under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Florian
Tschorsch](https://tu-dresden.de/ing/informatik/sya/ps/chair/tschorsch).

I am a computer scientist by profession with special interests in modern P2P
systems.
I hold a Master's from the Humboldt University in Berlin and I am currently
pursuing a PhD at the Technical University in Dresden.
My main research themes are the performance, security and resilience of
blockchain-based P2P networks such as the Lightning network.
My work tends to follow quantitative and empirical methods such as network
measurements and simulations, while often applying methods from adjacent fields
of computer science such as graph theory and game theory.
In the past, I have worked on some of the more theoretical aspects of
distributed computing such as incentives and analysis of open quorum systems
(under [Dr. Martin Florian's](https://m.flrn.cc/) supervision).
Prior to that, I worked on the analysis of complex graphs as a student assistant
in the [macsy
group](https://www.informatik.hu-berlin.de/de/forschung/gebiete/macsy).

I am also an amateur baker and often spend my free time trying out new recipes.

As of early 2024, I am a certified football referee in the Dresden football
association and regularly officiate local games.
