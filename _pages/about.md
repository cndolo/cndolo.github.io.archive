Hi, I am Charmaine (she/her) and I am currently working towards my PhD at the TU
Dresden.

I am a computer scientist by profession with special interests in computer
networks and their security, although I have a background in the analysis of
complex graphs.
I hold a Master's from the Humboldt University in Berlin and I am currently
pursuing a PhD at the Technical University in Dresden.
My main research themes are the performance, security and resilience of
blockchain-based P2P networks such as the Lightning network.
My work tends to follow quantitative and empirical methods such as network
measurements and simulations, while often applying methods from adjacent fields
of computer science such as game theory or graph theory.
In the past, I have worked on some of the more theoretical aspects of
distributed computing such as incentives in open quorum systems.

I am also an amateur baker and often spend my free time trying out new recipes.

As of late winter 2024, I am a certified football referee in the Dresden
football association and regulalrly officiate local games.
